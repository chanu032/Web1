    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, <br>
        dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted<br>
         programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the<br>
         three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used <br>
        to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video<br>
         games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers<br>
         support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript<br>
         engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different<br>
         implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification,<br>
         with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines<br>
         supporting additional features beyond ECMA.</p>
